# DevOps Theory (March 2021)

While undertaking an internship from February to April 2021, one of the assessments given was related to DevOps in a Microsoft Azure environment. The assessment was mostly practical in that you mess around with a given repository and see what happens. Of course, the assessment also included written answers on different theoretical aspects of DevOps.

Given how hands-on the assessment was, I am not able to share anything from the practical side of things. However, the written theory questions are generic enough that I do feel comfortable sharing them publicly.
